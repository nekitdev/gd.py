Contributing to gd.py
=====================

First of all, we are glad that you decided to contribute to our project.

Guidelines
----------

Here are some simple guidelines for creating good issues and pull requests:

1. When deciding to contribute, please check if there is already a solution for the problem;

2. We appreciate any contribution, whether it is a typo fix or huge addition to the project;

3. When creating any code changes, remember that code style really matters;

3.1. We are trying to follow PEP 8 within our code;

3.2. Though, our line length limit is 120 characters, and we tend to use more space to bring the readability;

4. If you have created a new function or method, please document it; that really helps end-users of our library.

Additional Commentary
---------------------

Questions regarding the library should be asked in the official server,
however, if you are sure a question should belong to GitHub, feel free to open a new issue.
